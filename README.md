<h2>About The Project</h2>

Pingly is a web platform designed to solve the biggest challenge in student life. It allows students to connnect with each other. 

Unlike traditional platforms that force you to be either strictly professional (LinkedIn) or strictly social (Instagram/Tinder), Pingly offers a Dual-Mode Architecture. With a single toggle, students can switch their persona, feed, and interactions to match their current vibe.

Whether you are looking for a pofessional partner to build the next big thing, or a Gym buddy to hit the weights with between classes, Pingly uses a smart Matching Algorithm to connect you with the right people at the right time.
